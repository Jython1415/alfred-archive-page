An [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) Workflow for archiving a webpage with the Wayback Machine.

## Installation

You can download the [latest release](https://github.com/Jython1415/alfred-archive-page/releases) (the `.alfredworkflow`) file, and add it to your list of workflows in Alfred (see [Alfred documentation on Workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/)).

## Usage

Archives the frontmost browser tab using Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. Alternatively, you can pass in a URL as an argument, or perform the action from Alfred clipboard history with the Universal Action.

- <kbd>â†©&#xFE0E;</kbd> Archive and copy the archive URL to clipboard.
- <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>â†©&#xFE0E;</kbd> Skip the check for existing snapshots. Directly request to create a new one.
- <kbd>âŒ¥</kbd><kbd>â†©&#xFE0E;</kbd> Copy the resulting URL in markdown format: `[archive](<URL>)`
- <kbd>âŒƒ</kbd><kbd>â†©&#xFE0E;</kbd> Open the Wayback Machine website for archiving. No automatic copy to clipboard.

- âœ… Configurable keyword
- âœ… "Always on" logging (configurable and off by default)
- âœ… Prompt to notify the developer when there is an unexpected error
- âœ… Skip creating a new archive if there is already a snapshot within the configured timeframe
- External triggers for key functionalities
- Failed snapshot requests are saved for retrying
- A "search" URL is returned instantly while the snapshot is completed in the background
- Helpful and configurable sounds
